# DistractedDrivingCNN

This is a CNN model which takes in a front-facing image of a driver and predicts whether the driver is drinking a beverage, using a mirror, using the radio or is focused on the road (attentive).

To train the model on your pc, clone the repository to a directory and then download the training data by running this in the terminal: 
```
pip install git+https://github.com/raghakot/keras-vis.git -U
```
